# README

Steps taken to "get here"

### Chapter One - Building, Running, and the REPL
1. Create a new Clojure app using Leiningen
  1. `$ lein new app clojure-noob`
  1. open `src/clojure-noob/core.clj` and edit the print statement
  1. compile and run in terminal with `$ lein run`
1. Create and run a standalone java file to distribute and for others to run (within the ignored directory target)
  * `$ lein uberjar` - creates two new files
    * `clojure-noob-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar`
    * `clojure-noob-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
  * `$ java -jar target/uberjar/clojure-noob-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar`
1. Use and play with the lein REPL
  * `$ lein repl`
  * Note that within the REPL, you are in the `clojure-noob.core` namespace. The only function defined is `-main`, and we can execute that function with `=> (-main)`
  * Also within the REPL, we can execute some basic Clojure functions:
    * `=> (+ 1 2 3 4)`
    * `=> (* 1 2 3 4)`
    * `=> (first [1 2 3 4])`
  * exit the REPL with `=> exit`
